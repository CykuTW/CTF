# Challenge

> Bobby has been into Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation lately.
> One day, he went to an amusement park in his city. It was very famouse for its Roller Coaster Rides.
> But, Bobby, being 12 years old, was not allowed on those rides, as it was open for people who were 14 years or older.
> This made Bobby very angry. On reaching home, he hacked into the servers of the amusement park, got hold of the validation software for the Roller Coaster rides, and modified it, so that nobody is allowed to have a ride on those Roller Coasters.
> 
> The authorities were in trouble now, as they weren't able to allow access to the Roller Coaster rides, without a Go-Ahead from their validation software.
> They have come to you, asking for your help to fix their issue. Can you help them with it ??
