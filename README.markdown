# Capture The Flag (CTF)

[Capture The Flag competitions](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/InfoSec#ctfs-and-hacking-games) often supply a number of small attachments or puzzle files. This repository is a collection of those assets and associated write-ups describing how to approach the challenge. The aim is to build an archive of challenges that our team members know how to tackle so as to educate our peers.
